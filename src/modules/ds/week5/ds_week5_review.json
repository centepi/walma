    {
      "content": "A key idea is the **fixed point**, where f(x) = 0. The system does not evolve at these points."

      "content": "**Phase portraits** are then drawn, showing the direction of motion on the x-axis depending on the sign of f(x)."

      "content": "- A fixed point is **stable** if trajectories move toward it."

      "content": "- It is **unstable** if nearby trajectories move away."

      "contentBeforeEquation": "Example: for",
      "inlineEquation": "f(x) = x - x^{4/3}",
      "contentAfterEquation": ", the fixed points are at x = 0 and x = 1, and we analyze the sign of f(x) around these values."

      "content": "We compared how different velocity functions affect whether a particle reaches its target in finite time."
    },
    {
      "content": "In phase spaces like  \\Gamma = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\geq 0\\} , it's also important to ask: does motion **terminate** in finite time?"

      "contentBeforeEquation": "For example, with",
      "inlineEquation": "\\dot{x} = \\sqrt{x}",
      "contentAfterEquation": ", solving the motion leads to a solution that reaches x = 0 in finite time, then terminates."

    {
      "content": "This shows how dynamics can behave differently when f(x) is nonlinear or singular at boundaries."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize: autonomous systems can be analyzed graphically and analytically by examining fixed points, stability, time evolution, and behavior near singularities."

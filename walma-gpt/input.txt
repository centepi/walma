This worksheet is for Week 3 of Calc II.
It covers gradients, level curves, and directional derivatives. The goal is to help students:
- Understand the meaning and computation of the gradient âˆ‡f
- Learn how the gradient relates to level curves
- Use the gradient to compute directional derivatives
- Interpret what a directional derivative means geometrically

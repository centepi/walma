        "Step 1: Understanding the Cross Product. The cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors. It is often used in physics and engineering to find a vector that is perpendicular to a surface or to determine the area of a parallelogram defined by two vectors. The cross product of two vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3) \\) is given by the formula: \\[ \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = (a_2b_3 - a_3b_2, a_3b_1 - a_1b_3, a_1b_2 - a_2b_1) \\].",

    You are an expert A-level Mathematics content creator. Your task is to create a NEW, ORIGINAL, and SELF-CONTAINED A-level question.
    {correction_prompt_section}
    --- CONTEXT: THE FULL ORIGINAL QUESTION ---
    {full_reference_text}

    --- INSPIRATION: THE TARGET PART ---
    This is the specific part of the original question you should use as inspiration for the skill to be tested.
    - Reference Part Content: "{target_part_content}"
    - Reference Part Solution: "{target_part_answer}"

    --- YOUR TASK ---
    Create a single, new, self-contained question that tests the same mathematical skill as the target part above, following the specified OUTPUT FORMAT.

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
    1.  **Self-Contained**: Your new question MUST have its own setup (a "question_stem") and a single question part.
    2.  **Invent New Values**: You MUST invent new functions, numbers, and scenarios.
    3.  **GUARANTEE A CLEAN ANSWER**: The values you invent MUST lead to a clean, elegant solution (e.g., integers, simple fractions, or simple surds).
    4.  **Contextual Visuals Only**: The 'visual_data' you generate must only contain information that helps the user understand the question. It must NEVER contain the answer itself. For example, if the question is 'Find the turning point', do NOT include 'turning_points' in the data. If the question is 'Calculate the shaded area', you SHOULD include the 'shaded_regions' data.
    5.  **Include Visuals if Appropriate**: If the skill is inherently visual, generate the 'visual_data' object.
    6.  **Calculator Use**: Determine if a calculator is required and set the 'calculator_required' field.
    7.  **NO DRAWING QUESTIONS**: The "question_text" you create must NEVER ask the student to "sketch", "draw", or "plot" a graph. If the reference question asks the student to draw, you must adapt the question to test the same knowledge with a text-based answer. For example, instead of "Sketch the graph of y = x^2", you could ask, "Describe the key features of the graph y = x^2, such as its shape, vertex, and any intercepts."

    **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
    Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the following structure:
    {{
      "question_stem": "A concise introduction/setup for your new question.",
      "parts": [
        {{
          "part_label": "a",
          "question_text": "The single task for the user to perform.",
          "solution_text": "The detailed, step-by-step solution to your new question."
        }}
      ],
      "calculator_required": true,
      "visual_data": {{...}} // Omit this key entirely if no visual is needed
    }}

    **'visual_data' structure (if needed)**:
    The 'visual_data' object must contain a 'graphs' array. You can also add OPTIONAL arrays for 'labeled_points' and 'shaded_regions'.
    Example of a rich 'visual_data' object:
    {{
        "graphs": [
            {{
                "id": "g1",
                "label": "y = f(x)",
                "explicit_function": "A Python-compatible expression like 'x**2 - 4*x + 7'",
                "visual_features": {{ "type": "parabola", "x_intercepts": null, "y_intercept": 7, "turning_points": [{{ "x": 2, "y": 3 }}], "axes_range": {{ "x_min": -1, "x_max": 5, "y_min": 0, "y_max": 10 }} }}
            }}
        ],
        "labeled_points": [
            {{ "label": "A", "x": 1.0, "y": 4.0 }}
        ],
        "shaded_regions": [
            {{
                "upper_bound_id": "g1",
                "lower_bound_id": "y=0",
                "x_start": 1.0,
                "x_end": 4.0
            }}
        ]
    }}

    **JSON TECHNICAL RULES**:
    - All backslashes `\\` within JSON string values MUST be escaped (e.g., `"\\\\(x^2\\\\)"`).

    **FINAL CHECK**: Before responding, ensure the question has a clean solution and the JSON is valid. Output ONLY the JSON object.

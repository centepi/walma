            "solution_text": "The perimeter of the rectangle is given by \\(2x + 2y = 22\\), which simplifies to \\(x + y = 11\\).  The area of the rectangle is given by \\(xy = 28\\). From the perimeter equation, we can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(y = 11 - x\\). Substituting this into the area equation gives \\(x(11 - x) = 28\\), which expands to \\(11x - x^2 = 28\\). Rearranging this gives the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 11x + 28 = 0\\). This can be factored as \\((x - 4)(x - 7) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(x = 4\\) or \\(x = 7\\). When \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 11 - 4 = 7\\). When \\(x = 7\\), \\(y = 11 - 7 = 4\\). Thus, the length is 7 cm and the width is 4 cm (or vice versa)."

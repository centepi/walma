            "solution_text": "The perimeter is given by \\(2l + 2w = 20\\), which simplifies to \\(l + w = 10\\). The area is given by \\(lw = 21\\). From the perimeter equation, we can express \\(l\\) in terms of \\(w\\): \\(l = 10 - w\\). Substituting this into the area equation gives \\((10 - w)w = 21\\), which expands to \\(10w - w^2 = 21\\). Rearranging this gives the quadratic equation \\(w^2 - 10w + 21 = 0\\). Factoring this quadratic yields \\((w - 3)(w - 7) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(w = 3\\) or \\(w = 7\\). If \\(w = 3\\), then \\(l = 10 - 3 = 7\\). If \\(w = 7\\), then \\(l = 10 - 7 = 3\\).  Since length is typically the longer side, we have \\(l = 7\\) cm and \\(w = 3\\) cm."

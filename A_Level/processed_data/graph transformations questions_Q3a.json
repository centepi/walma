So the curve intersects the y-axis at (0, -4).\nTo find any x-intercepts, we set y = 0: \\(0 = \\frac{4}{x - 1}\\).  This equation has no solutions, so the curve does not intersect the x-axis.\nThe vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is zero, i.e., \\(x - 1 = 0\\), so \\(x = 1\\) is the equation of the vertical asymptote.\nAs \\(x \\to \\pm \\infty\\), \\(f(x) \\to 0\\). Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\)."

We are given that the area is greater than 28 cm\\(^2\\), so we can form the inequality:\n\\(x(x+3) > 28\\)\n\\(x^2 + 3x > 28\\)\n\\(x^2 + 3x - 28 > 0\\)\nTo find the critical values, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation:\n\\(x^2 + 3x - 28 = 0\\)\n\\((x+7)(x-4) = 0\\)\nSo the critical values are \\(x = -7\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\nSince the quadratic \\(x^2 + 3x - 28\\) represents a parabola that opens upwards, the inequality \\(x^2 + 3x - 28 > 0\\) is satisfied when \\(x\\) is outside the interval between the roots.  Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \\(x < -7\\) or \\(x > 4\\).\nSince \\(x\\) represents a width, it must be positive, so we disregard the solution \\(x < -7\\).  Thus, the possible values of \\(x\\) are \\(x > 4\\)."

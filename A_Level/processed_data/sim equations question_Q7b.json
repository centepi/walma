            "solution_text": "The perimeter is given by \\(2l + 2w = 20\\), which simplifies to \\(l + w = 10\\), or \\(l = 10 - w\\). The area is given by \\(lw = 21\\). Substituting the expression for \\(l\\) into the area equation gives \\((10 - w)w = 21\\). Expanding and rearranging gives \\(w^2 - 10w + 21 = 0\\). This quadratic factorises to \\((w - 3)(w - 7) = 0\\). Thus, \\(w = 3\\) or \\(w = 7\\). If \\(w = 3\\), then \\(l = 10 - 3 = 7\\). If \\(w = 7\\), then \\(l = 10 - 7 = 3\\).  Since length is typically the longer side, we can say length = 7cm and width = 3cm."

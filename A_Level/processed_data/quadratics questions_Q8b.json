This gives two inequalities:\n\n1. \\(s > 10\\):\n\\(t^2 - 2t + 9 > 10\\)\n\\(t^2 - 2t - 1 > 0\\)\nUsing the quadratic formula, \\(t = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\)\nSo \\(t > 1 + \\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(t < 1 - \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n2. \\(s < -10\\):\n\\(t^2 - 2t + 9 < -10\\)\n\\(t^2 - 2t + 19 < 0\\)\nThe discriminant is \\((-2)^2 - 4(1)(19) = 4 - 76 = -72 < 0\\). Since the coefficient of \\(t^2\\) is positive, the quadratic is always positive, meaning there are no real solutions to this inequality.\n\nTherefore, combining the solutions from both cases, the set of possible values for \\(t\\) is \\(t > 1 + \\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(t < 1 - \\sqrt{2}\\)."

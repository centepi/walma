For the area to be positive, we require \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15 > 0\\).\n\nWe first find the critical values by solving the equation \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0\\).  This can be factored as \\((2x - 3)(x + 5) = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the critical values are \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(x = -5\\).\n\nSince the quadratic has a positive leading coefficient, the parabola opens upwards. Thus, the quadratic is positive when \\(x < -5\\) or \\(x > \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nHowever, since \\(x\\) represents the width of a rectangle, \\(x\\) must be positive. Therefore, the set of possible values for \\(x\\) is \\(x > \\frac{3}{2}\\)."

This quadratic factorises to \\((t-2)(t-3) > 0\\), which gives the solution \\(t < 2\\) or \\(t > 3\\).\nThe velocity is negative when \\(2t - 5 < 0\\), which simplifies to \\(t < \\frac{5}{2}\\) or \\(t < 2.5\\).\nWe are looking for the values of \\(t\\) that satisfy BOTH inequalities. Combining the solutions, we get \\(t < 2\\)."

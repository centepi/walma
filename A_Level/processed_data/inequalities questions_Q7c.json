            "solution_text": "First, we find the velocity function by differentiating the displacement function with respect to time:\n\\(v = \\frac{ds}{dt} = 3t^2 - 18t + 24\\)\nWe are looking for the time interval where \\(v < 3\\):\n\\(3t^2 - 18t + 24 < 3\\)\n\\(3t^2 - 18t + 21 < 0\\)\nDivide by 3:\n\\(t^2 - 6t + 7 < 0\\)\nWe can find the roots of the quadratic \\(t^2 - 6t + 7 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\(t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 28}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\)\nTherefore, the roots are \\(3 - \\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(3 + \\sqrt{2}\\).\nSince the quadratic has a positive leading coefficient, the inequality \\(t^2 - 6t + 7 < 0\\) is satisfied between the roots.  Thus, the velocity is less than 3 m/s when \\(3 - \\sqrt{2} < t < 3 + \\sqrt{2}\\).  Approximately, this is \\(1.586 < t < 4.414\\)."

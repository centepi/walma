This means the y-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g(x)\\) are multiplied by 3, while the x-coordinates remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the points \\((1, 2)\\), \\((2, 5)\\), and \\((3, -1)\\) on \\(y=g(x)\\) transform to:\n\n* \\((1, 2)\\) becomes \\((1, 2 \\times 3) = (1, 6)\\)\n* \\((2, 5)\\) becomes \\((2, 5 \\times 3) = (2, 15)\\)\n* \\((3, -1)\\) becomes \\((3, -1 \\times 3) = (3, -3)\\)\n\nSo the graph of \\(y = 3g(x)\\) passes through the points \\((1, 6)\\), \\((2, 15)\\), and \\((3, -3)\\)."

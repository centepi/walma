            "solution_text": "First, find the derivative of the curve: \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - 2\\). At P\\((4, 11)\\), the gradient is \\(2(4) - 2 = 6\\). Let the coordinates of Q be \\((x_q, y_q)\\). Since Q lies on the curve, \\(y_q = x_q^2 - 2x_q + 3\\). The gradient of PQ is given by \\(\\frac{y_q - 11}{x_q - 4}\\). We are given that this gradient is equal to the gradient of the curve at P, which is 6. So, \\(\\frac{x_q^2 - 2x_q + 3 - 11}{x_q - 4} = 6\\). Simplifying, we get \\(\\frac{x_q^2 - 2x_q - 8}{x_q - 4} = 6\\), which leads to \\(x_q^2 - 2x_q - 8 = 6x_q - 24\\). Rearranging gives \\(x_q^2 - 8x_q + 16 = 0\\). This quadratic factorises to \\((x_q - 4)^2 = 0\\), so \\(x_q = 4\\). Thus, Q has x-coordinate 4, the same as P. Therefore, PQ is a vertical line, parallel to the y-axis."

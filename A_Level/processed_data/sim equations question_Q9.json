            "solution_text": "The perimeter of the rectangle is given by \\(2x + 2y = 14\\), which simplifies to \\(x + y = 7\\). The area of the rectangle is given by \\(xy = 10\\).  From the perimeter equation, we can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(y = 7 - x\\). Substituting this into the area equation gives \\(x(7 - x) = 10\\), which expands to \\(7x - x^2 = 10\\). Rearranging this gives the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\\). This factorises as \\((x - 2)(x - 5) = 0\\), so \\(x = 2\\) or \\(x = 5\\). If \\(x = 2\\), then \\(y = 7 - 2 = 5\\). If \\(x = 5\\), then \\(y = 7 - 5 = 2\\). Therefore, the length and width of the rectangle are 5 cm and 2 cm (or vice-versa)."

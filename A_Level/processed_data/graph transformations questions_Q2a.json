The x-intercepts remain unchanged, as stretching vertically does not affect where the graph crosses the x-axis. Therefore, the x-intercepts are still \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 3\\), which correspond to the coordinates \\((-1, 0)\\) and \\((3, 0)\\). \n\nThe minimum point of \\(y = g(x)\\) is at \\((1, -2)\\).  When the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of 3, the y-coordinate of the minimum point is multiplied by 3. Thus, the new minimum point is at \\((1, 3 \\times -2)\\), which simplifies to \\((1, -6)\\)."

First, we calculate the squared lengths of the sides RS, ST, and RT.\nRS² = (5-1)² + (6-2)² = 4² + 4² = 16 + 16 = 32\nST² = (7-5)² + (4-6)² = 2² + (-2)² = 4 + 4 = 8\nRT² = (7-1)² + (4-2)² = 6² + 2² = 36 + 4 = 40\nNow we check if the Pythagorean theorem holds: RS² + ST² = 32 + 8 = 40 = RT². Since RT² = RS² + ST², triangle RST is a right-angled triangle, and the right angle is at S, therefore ∠RST is a right angle."

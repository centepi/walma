We have \\(f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6\\). By trial and error or using the factor theorem, we can see that \\(f(2) = 8 - 16 + 2 + 6 = 0\\), so \\(x-2\\) is a factor.  Using polynomial division, we have:\n\\(f(x) = (x-2)(x^2 - 2x - 3) = (x-2)(x-3)(x+1)\\).\nThe x-intercepts of \\(f(x)\\) are \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\), which correspond to the points \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\) and \\((3, 0)\\). \n\nSince \\(g(x)\\) is \\(f(x)\\) shifted 3 units to the left, the x-intercepts of \\(g(x)\\) are \\(x = -1 - 3 = -4\\), \\(x = 2 - 3 = -1\\) and \\(x = 3 - 3 = 0\\).  \n\nThe coordinates where \\(y = g(x)\\) intersects the x-axis are \\((-4, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), and \\((0, 0)\\)."

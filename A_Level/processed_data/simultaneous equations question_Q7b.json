            "solution_text": "The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \\(2l + 2w\\). We are given that the perimeter is 26 cm, so \\(2l + 2w = 26\\). Dividing by 2 gives \\(l + w = 13\\), so \\(l = 13 - w\\).\nThe area of the rectangle is given by \\(lw\\) and also by the expression \\(w^2 + 4w - 12\\).  Therefore, \\(lw = w^2 + 4w - 12\\).\nSubstituting \\(l = 13 - w\\) into the area equation gives \\((13 - w)w = w^2 + 4w - 12\\).\nExpanding the left side gives \\(13w - w^2 = w^2 + 4w - 12\\).\nRearranging gives \\(2w^2 - 9w - 12 = 0\\).\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factorising: \\((2w + 3)(w - 4) = 0\\).\nTherefore, \\(w = -\\frac{3}{2}\\) or \\(w = 4\\). Since width cannot be negative, \\(w = 4\\) cm."

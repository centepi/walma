The first plank must be longer than the second plank.  Furthermore, x represents a length, and therefore must be positive.",

            "solution_text": "The first plank is longer than the second, so we can write the inequality: 5x + 8 > 3x + 5. Subtracting 3x from both sides gives 2x + 8 > 5. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x > -3. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x > -3/2 or x > -1.5. Since x represents a length and must be positive, x > 0. Combining both conditions, x > -1.5 AND x > 0, simplifies to x > 0."

            "solution_text": "We can rewrite both sides of the equation using the same base. Since 9 = \\(3^2\\) and 27 = \\(3^3\\), the equation can be rewritten as \\((3^2)^{2x} = (3^3)^{x+2}\\).  Using the power of a power rule, this simplifies to \\(3^{4x} = 3^{3(x+2)}\\) or \\(3^{4x} = 3^{3x+6}\\).  Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal: \\(4x = 3x + 6\\). Subtracting \\(3x\\) from both sides gives \\(x = 6\\)."

Since the quadratic is positive, we want the 'outside' region, so \\(t < 1\\) or \\(t > \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\n2. \\((2t - 1)(t - 3) < 2\\):\n\\(2t^2 - 7t + 3 < 2\\)\n\\(2t^2 - 7t + 1 < 0\\)\nWe use the quadratic formula to find the critical values:\n\\(t = \\frac{-(-7) \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(2)(1)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 8}}{4} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{41}}{4}\\)\nTherefore, \\(t = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{41}}{4}\\) and \\(t = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{41}}{4}\\). Since the quadratic is negative, we want the 'inside' region, so \\(\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{41}}{4} < t < \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{41}}{4}\\).\n\nCombining both inequalities, the particle is within 2 metres of O when \\(\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{41}}{4} < t < 1\\) or \\(\\frac{5}{2} < t < \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{41}}{4}\\)."

Therefore, to find the corresponding points on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\), we subtract 4 from the y-coordinate of each point on \\(y = g(x)\\).\n\nFor the point (1, 3):\n\\(h(1) = g(1) - 4 = 3 - 4 = -1\\). The new point is (1, -1).\n\nFor the point (2, -1):\n\\(h(2) = g(2) - 4 = -1 - 4 = -5\\). The new point is (2, -5).\n\nFor the point (3, 5):\n\\(h(3) = g(3) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1\\). The new point is (3, 1).\n\nTherefore, the corresponding points on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\) are \\((1, -1)\\), \\((2, -5)\\), and \\((3, 1)\\)."

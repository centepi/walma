Therefore, the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0, 2)\\).\n\nTo find the \\(x\\)-intercept, we need to find where \\(h(x) = 0\\). We don't have an explicit equation for \\(h(x)\\), but we can see that \\(h(-1)=-1\\) and \\(h(0)=2\\). Since the graph has crossed the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=0\\), there must be an \\(x\\)-intercept in that interval. Similarly, \\(h(0)=2\\) and \\(h(2)=-4\\). This indicates another \\(x\\)-intercept between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\)."

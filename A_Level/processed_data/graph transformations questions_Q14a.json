Therefore, the minimum point of \\(y = g(x) + 5\\) will have the same x-coordinate as the minimum point of \\(y = g(x)\\), but the y-coordinate will be increased by 5.  The original minimum point is \\((3, -2)\\).  Adding 5 to the y-coordinate gives \\(-2 + 5 = 3\\).  Therefore, the minimum point of \\(y = g(x) + 5\\) is at \\((3, 3)\\)."

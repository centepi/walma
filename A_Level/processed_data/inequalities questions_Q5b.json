            "solution_text": "We are given the displacement equation \\(s = 3t^2 - 16t + 5\\) and we need to find when \\(s < 5\\). So, \\(3t^2 - 16t + 5 < 5\\).  Subtracting 5 from both sides gives \\(3t^2 - 16t < 0\\). Factorising this gives \\(t(3t - 16) < 0\\). The critical values are \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = \\frac{16}{3}\\). Since the quadratic \\(3t^2 - 16t\\) has a positive coefficient for the \\(t^2\\) term, its graph is a parabola that opens upwards. Thus, the inequality \\(3t^2 - 16t < 0\\) is satisfied between the roots.  Therefore, the particle is less than 5 metres from O when \\(0 < t < \\frac{16}{3}\\)."

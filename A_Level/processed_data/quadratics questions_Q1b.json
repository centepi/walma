Substituting the expression for \\(s\\), we have\n\n\\(-12 < 2t^2 + 5t - 12 < 12\\)\n\nWe can split this into two separate inequalities:\n\n1. \\(2t^2 + 5t - 12 > -12\\)\n   \\(2t^2 + 5t > 0\\)\n   \\(t(2t + 5) > 0\\)\n   This inequality holds when \\(t < -\\frac{5}{2}\\) or \\(t > 0\\).\n\n2. \\(2t^2 + 5t - 12 < 12\\)\n   \\(2t^2 + 5t - 24 < 0\\)\n\nTo find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\(t = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-24)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 192}}{4} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{217}}{4}\\)\n\nSo, the roots are approximately \\(t \\approx \\frac{-5 \\pm 14.73}{4}\\), giving \\(t \\approx -4.93\\) and \\(t \\approx 2.43\\).\n\nSince we want the values where the quadratic is less than zero, we have \\(-4.93 < t < 2.43\\).\n\nCombining the inequalities, we need \\(t\\) to satisfy both \\(t < -\\frac{5}{2}\\) or \\(t > 0\\), and \\(-4.93 < t < 2.43\\).  This means \\(0 < t < 2.43\\).  More accurately, \\(0 < t < \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{217}}{4}\\)."

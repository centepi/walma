We first solve the quadratic equation \\(2t^2 - 11t + 9 = 0\\). This factors as \\((2t - 9)(t - 1) = 0\\), giving \\(t = \\frac{9}{2}\\) and \\(t = 1\\). Since the quadratic has a positive coefficient of \\(t^2\\), the inequality \\(2t^2 - 11t + 9 > 0\\) is satisfied when \\(t < 1\\) or \\(t > \\frac{9}{2}\\). Since time must be positive, the set of values of \\(t\\) for which the particle is more than 3 metres away from O is \\(0 < t < 1\\) and \\(t > \\frac{9}{2}\\)."

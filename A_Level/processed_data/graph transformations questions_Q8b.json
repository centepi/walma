Since \\(h(x) = g(x) + 10\\), the x-intercepts of \\(h(x)\\) occur when \\(g(x) + 10 = 0\\), or \\(g(x) = -10\\).  We don't know the full form of \\(g(x)\\), so we can't determine these x-intercepts. \n\nThe y-intercept of \\(g(x)\\) occurs when \\(x = 0\\), and is \\(g(0) = -5\\).  The y-intercept of \\(h(x)\\) occurs when \\(x = 0\\), and is \\(h(0) = g(0) + 10 = -5 + 10 = 5\\).  Therefore, the y-intercept of \\(h(x)\\) is \\((0, 5)\\). \n\nSo, the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) crosses the y-axis at \\((0, 5)\\).  We cannot determine where it crosses the x-axis without more information about \\(g(x)\\)."

Then the minimum point is at (1, -2). \nFor the graph of \\(y = g(3x)\\), the x-coordinate is scaled by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). The y-coordinate remains unchanged.\nTherefore, the minimum point of \\(y = g(3x)\\) is at \\((\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1, -2)\\), which simplifies to \\((\\frac{1}{3}, -2)\\)."

            "solution_text": "Let \\(C_1\\) be the cost of the first company and \\(C_2\\) be the cost of the second company. We are given:\n\\(C_1 = 10 + 2x\\)\n\\(C_2 = 5 + 2.5x\\)\nWe want to find the distances \\(x\\) for which \\(C_1 < C_2\\).\nSo, \\(10 + 2x < 5 + 2.5x\\)\nSubtract \\(2x\\) from both sides: \\(10 < 5 + 0.5x\\)\nSubtract 5 from both sides: \\(5 < 0.5x\\)\nDivide both sides by 0.5: \\(x > \\frac{5}{0.5}\\)\n\\(x > 10\\)\nTherefore, the first company is cheaper for distances greater than 10 miles. Since the radius is 50 miles, the first company is cheaper for distances \\(10 < x \\le 50\\) miles."
